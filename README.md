# config files

In this repo I keep some useful scripts to help and improve my setup, specially after formatting or in a new computer.

Currently, I have some notes for the following:

- [Pop!_OS](./pop_os/)
  - the [post install](./pop_os/postinstall.sh) script is a really useful one, I got most of it from [diolinux](https://github.com/Diolinux/pop-os-postinstall)
- [Manjaro](./manjaro/)
